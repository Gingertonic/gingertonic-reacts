# Ready to React?

Starting a new React project? Great!

- Not looking forward to the initial webpack setup? \
- Can't make up your mind on a file structure? \
- Fed up of Googling for Jest setup? 

You're very welcome to start here! This is a boilerplate plus a bit, laid out the way I like it - your mileage may vary greatly!

## Setup
- Click the friendly, green 'Use this template' button to your top right
- Follow the prompts to create a new repository
- Clone down your new repo
- `cd <your-repo-name>`
- `npm install`
