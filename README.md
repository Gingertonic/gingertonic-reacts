# Ready to React?

Starting a new React project? Great!

- Not looking forward to the initial webpack setup? \
- Can't make up your mind on a file structure? \
- Fed up of Googling for Jest setup? 

You're very welcome to start here! This is a boilerplate plus a bit, laid out the way I like it - your mileage may vary greatly!

## Usage
- `git clone git@github.com:Gingertonic/gingertonic-reacts.git`
- `cd gingertonic-reacts`
- `npm install`
